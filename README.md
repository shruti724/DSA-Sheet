# DSA-Sheet

## Description
DSA-Sheet is a collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a reference and practice resource for students and professionals studying and working with data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- Implementation of popular algorithms like sorting (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort), searching (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), etc.
- Well-documented code with explanations and time complexities for each data structure and algorithm.
- Organized into different modules for easy navigation and understanding.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Explore different modules to find the desired data structure or algorithm implementation.
4. Open the Python file for the selected data structure or algorithm.
5. Run the file to see the implementation in action or integrate it into your project.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, want to suggest improvements, or have new data structure or algorithm implementations to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
